This program is based off of a lesson from 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu on Udemy. Upon execution, it opens up a GUI that will either recall a stored password or store a new one. The new password can be self-created or generated by the program. The length of the password as well as the desired number of letters and symbols can be adjusted in the code.

An addition that was made is a function that syncs up two files containing password data and alphabetizes them. This is useful if keeping the files local on multiple devices. 

Requirements:
